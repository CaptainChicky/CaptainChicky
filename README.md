### Hi there! It's me, Chicky üòã!

- üê¶ I am also science/bird enthusiast, an avid üéπpianst/violinistüéª, and a hobby writer üìù.
- üòÑ Pronouns: He/him.
- üíº I created small scripts like the [Hash retriever](https://github.com/CaptainChicky/Hash-Retriever) and potpourris of tools along with other useful things, as seen in my repository "[Activating Microsoft Products for testing](https://github.com/CaptainChicky/Activate-Microsoft-products-for-testing-in-virtual-machines)"! 
- ‚ö° Fun fact: China currently just took a large rock from the moon. Very intriguing.
